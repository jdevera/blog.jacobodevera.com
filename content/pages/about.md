# The Author

Hello, my name is Jacobo de Vera `/xa'kobo de 'βeɾa/` and I am a 31 year old
Computer Engineer, father, and husband.

I was born and bred in the sunny island of Tenerife, Spain. In 2007, I moved to
the not so sunny Ireland, where I currently live and work.

I like playing guitar and singing, and for a while, I even wrote songs. This is
something I hope to retake in the future.

Currently, I spend most of my spare time with my awesome children and wife.
When they sleep, though, I write software, or sometimes write about writing
software, or simply write.

In software, I like clean and beautiful. At work, though, I try to be more
pragmatic and engineery. I like tests and good documentation. I try to remember
that when I write software myself.

As usual, Google can tell you a lot more if you ask: [Jacobo de Vera][googleme]

If you want to contact me, you can simply [drop me an email][email], or you can
find me in a variety of places, you can see more about that on my [main
site][mainsite].



## The Blog

I've had some form of blog since 2002, mainly personal. Since then I have
started a handful of blogs with great intentions but zero commitment.

This time it's not different.

This blog intends to collect my writings both in Spanish and English about both
personal and technical topics. I'll create separate feeds for the main areas so
you can subscribe to one and never see the others.
